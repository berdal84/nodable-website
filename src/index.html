                    <p>The goal of Nodable is to provide an original source code editor using both textual and nodal paradigms.
                        Via this hybrid prototype, technical and less-technical people can discuss and collaborate on the same source code.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike other nodal softwares, the goal of Nodable is to make possible the edition of the source code and its graph representation at the same time. Users are not stuck into one of the two paradigms, they can go back and forth whenever they want.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Handle more keywords: <code>return</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, etc.,</li>
                        <li>Handle more structures: <code>while</code>,</li>
                        <li>Improve user experience from a graph perspective,</li>
                        <li>Handle function definitions,</li>
                        <li>Find a deterministic way to unfold the graph (to use less CPU),</li>
                        <li>Optimize the Graph (memory allocation),</li>
                        <li>Reduce unnecessary complexity (getter/setters, inheritance),</li>
                        <li>Continue to run benchmarks to speed-up the software.</li>

                    <p>3D Artist for almost 10 years, I was used to work using <a title="See Wikipedia article about Maya" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Maya">Maya</a>
                    (a 3D software built with the nodal paradigm in mind) and I knew the potential of such programs for artists.</p>
                    <p>Later, when I finished my reconversion from 3D Art to Development, I had the chance to met talented people working on video games (at WildSheepStudio), one of them was
                    producing VFX using a nodal UI. I heard comments from programmers about it: creating something with nodes takes too much time and produces an incomprehensible graph, it is way more efficient to use code.</p>
                    <p>Programmers point of view makes sense, but if graphs are the only way for certain to create a program, that makes sense too.</p>
                    <p>From all that poped an idea: why nodes and code cannot work together? What if programmers and technical artists could see the same program from two diffent angle?</p>
                    <p>That's how I started to code, very slowly...</p>
                    <p>BTW, I had tons of conversation with a colleague about it. He was telling me: "√ßa va faire un joli sapin de no√´l lumineux!" (this will be a pretty bright Christmas tree!)</p>
